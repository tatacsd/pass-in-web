## ðŸš€ Tecnologies

This project was developed using the following technologies:
- [React](https://reactjs.org)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

## ðŸ’» Project
The application is a straightforward dashboard simulation featuring a roster of event attendees. Users can easily navigate through the attendee list via pagination and apply name filters for quick searching. Additionally, we've implemented URL state functionality, enabling users to share specific filtered views by simply sharing the link.

### ðŸ“š What I've learned with this project
- How to use Vite to create a React application
- How to add TailwindCSS to the project
- How to use DayJS to format dates for minutes, hours, and days, or even to calculate the difference between two dates
- How to use Lucide Icons to add icons to the project
- How to use FakerJS to generate fake data while we don't have a backend set up
- How to use Date-fns - another library to work with dates
- How to use URL state to share the state of the application with others by sharing the link
